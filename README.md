Artificial Intelligence in Robotics was my first class into this field at OMSCS. Through the class, I learn a number of algorithm to program a robot to:
-	Localize using Bayesian update, Kalman Filter and Particle Filter
-	Search for and travel using an optimal path
-	Perform Stochastic Universal sampling

The algorithms are not difficult to understand and not mathematically intensive. 

The last, most challenging project in the class is to direct a robot to pick up and drop off boxes in a warehouse. The robot does not know its location, but can only sense (with some noise) the boxes and obstacles in sight. The key issues to deal with is:
-	How to program the robots to make decisions under a lot of uncertainty
-	How to filter out the workable data from the noisy measurements 
-	How the robot can explore its surrounding almost exhaustively

The class is an opportunity for me to use Python to solve interesting problem. I already have experienced with Bread-first search and backtracking through the game Bloxorz in Scala, but the path finding algorithm in the class features a solution that is easy to understand and to implement. Moreover, I also learn the syntax of Unit Testing in Python by browsing the provided testing codes.
